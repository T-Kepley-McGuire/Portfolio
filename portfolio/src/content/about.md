## About Me

Hello! I'm someone who finds joy in the intricate wonders of life, both indoors and out. I have an affinity for the great outdoors and often find solace in the midst of nature during my hikes. When I'm not exploring the wilderness, you'll find me immersed in the virtual realms of well-crafted video games, where my imagination takes flight.

I have a deep-rooted love for the elegant language of mathematics and the perplexing mysteries of philosophy and theology. Exploring the intricate dance of numbers and the profound questions of existence never fail to captivate my mind.

### Professional Journey: A Story of Passion and Innovation

My journey into the realm of technology and creativity began with a simple yet ambitious projectâ€”an ASCII graphing calculator coded in Python. This venture, although modest, laid the foundation for my passion for programming and problem-solving. Despite the challenges, I persevered, learning the ropes of coding while crafting a tool that visualized mathematical concepts in a unique way.

Eager to push my boundaries, I delved into the complex universe of neural networks. With sheer determination and a touch of audacity, I embarked on creating an AI that would play the classic game of Snake. Looking back, it was a project that stretched the limits of my skills and patience, but it taught me invaluable lessons about machine learning and algorithms.

Undeterred by the intricacies of the digital world, I set my sights on the mesmerizing beauty of fractals. Armed with Java, I developed a Mandelbrot set rendering engine, diving into the fascinating realm where mathematics meets art. The intricate patterns and infinite complexity of fractals became my canvas, and I reveled in the process of bringing these mathematical marvels to life.

Inspired by my earlier successes, I ventured into the realm of game development. One of my proudest achievements was the creation of a realistic water shader, where I meticulously simulated the ebb and flow of water, capturing its essence in pixels. Building on this accomplishment, I delved into the realm of GPU instancing and crafted a grass shader that brought virtual landscapes to life, one blade of grass at a time.

This journey, marked by passion, determination, and a relentless pursuit of knowledge, continues to shape my identity as a programmer and a creative soul. With each project, I explore new horizons, seeking to unravel the mysteries of technology and artistic expression. As I move forward, I remain driven by the endless possibilities that the world of programming and game development offers, ready to embark on the next chapter of my adventure.

#### Thinkful

My thirst for knowledge and passion for coding led me to a pivotal chapter in my professional journey: enrolling in Thinkful, a renowned coding school. Here, I delved into the world of web development, honing my skills and mastering the art of creating dynamic, user-friendly websites.

In the initial stages, I focused on crafting polished user interfaces, starting with a simple front-end static Bootstrap webpage designed to display a library's inventory. This project not only sharpened my design sensibilities but also laid the groundwork for my understanding of user experience and interface aesthetics.

Eager to explore the backend intricacies, I transitioned my focus to backend development. Armed with newfound knowledge, I delved into the complexities of RESTful APIs, mastering the art of building robust and efficient server-side architectures. Creating seamless connections between the frontend and backend became second nature as I delved deeper into the world of server-side programming.

With my frontend and backend expertise in place, I embarked on a comprehensive, full-stack project that showcased my skills and creativity. The result was a sophisticated web application designed to streamline the reservation process for a hypothetical restaurant. This project challenged me to integrate all my knowledge, from frontend design to backend logic, creating a seamless user experience from start to finish.

The Thinkful experience not only equipped me with technical prowess but also instilled in me a profound understanding of collaborative development, problem-solving, and project management. Armed with this comprehensive skill set, I emerged from Thinkful prepared to tackle complex challenges and contribute meaningfully to the ever-evolving landscape of web development.
