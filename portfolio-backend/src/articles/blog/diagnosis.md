### A Record Patient 0

#### On the multitude of diagnoses

Upon opening my practice today, a patient was admitted presenting a peculiar set of symptoms. The chief symptoms were severe divisive socio-degeneracy and poor circulation of the econosystem. Before addressing the patient, I investigated his medical history and found he had previously been admitted for similar (albeit less severe) symptoms and had received a multitude of diagnoses ranging from an improper diversification of diet to extreme stress from external factors (a previous relationship seemed to be the reason for this diagnosis, although my patient has since severed this relationship only for the symptoms to reappear). I must confess I found all of these diagnoses confusing to say the least. I simply could not square the symptoms I was informed of with the diagnoses and I certainly could not explain the sheer multitude of opinions. Furthermore, for having visited so many doctors, I would have thought my patient to have had some degree of help in his distress, but instead it seemed to be increasing by the day. I was to find out the reason shortly.

#### The evaluation of the patient

After this rather confusing review of the history, I went to see the patient. I asked him what the problem was, and his reply was a sheer avalanche of symptoms but just as the nurse had said, the two that were the most troubling were the divisive socio-degeneracy and the improper circulation of his econosystem. I set to work immediately. My first intuition was that this case was similar to one famous case I had been told about by my teachers. However, the patient in that case had not begun showing symptoms at such a young age as my patient (my patient being only about 250 years old). However, because of the similarity in presentation, I began my investigation by comparing the cases. 

My patient and this previous patient both exhibited the same peculiar symptoms but what made my investigation difficult was the rate at which my patient had advanced and seemed to be continuing to advance. However, I was able discover the reason for this with some very careful thought. 

#### On the rapidity of advance

My patient has advanced in his illness with such rapidity several reasons, but it seems a great deal of those reasons are actually from previous prescriptions that other practitioners have advised. No doubt their intentions were good but whether due to inexperience or a misguided training, their solutions missed the mark. One particular prescription sticks out to me here so I will relate how it came to be and why it was so detrimental.

Recently, my patient went to see a doctor trained in the modern discipline for a cure to his illness. After seeing the lengthy medical hisotry like I had and interviewing the patient, the doctor recommended for his socio-degeneracy a strong treatment of *The Sharing of Ideas*, and luckily there was a new delivery method that had just come out aptly labeled *The Internet*. This treatment was supposed to address the divisive socio-degeneracy by increasing a sharing of remedial ideas throughout the patient's body. This was supposed to surpress the divisive nature of the symptom and thus allow the remedial ideas to have their affect. Unfortunately, this prescription backfired terribly.

The patient began his treatment but it was at this point that it seems the disease spread all the more rapidly. The affect of *The Internet* was quite the opposite to what was supposed to happen because the areas of the body that were most full of remedial ideas were now able to communicate and quickly lost any interest in relating outside of their own local space. Meanwhile, those areas of the body with destructive ideas quickly spread over any area which had not already isolated. The terrible humor served to hamper the already crippled circulatory econosystem which in turn worsened the divisive socio-degeneracy. Unfortunately, the doctor had not seen fit to address the ciculatory issue, probably assuming reductively (as is the habit of those trained in the modern discipline) that addressing the divisive symptom would alleviate the circulatory issue. This naivety may be excused given the proven affectiveness of similar treatments in other areas.

What was not to be excused however was the borderline malicious neglect of his colleague. This colleague (trained in the postmodern discipline) likely was able to see the struggle that administering *The Internet* would bring on, but to those trained in this doctor's discipline, that is the natural state of affairs and should not be hampered. Indeed it should be encouraged. I do not doubt that this colleague allowed this prescription with the purpose of obtaining this result. If it was not his express purpose, it was perhaps his subconcious hope. I wish this colleague to step back and look at the poor state my patient is currently in and to make an honest evaluation of his health. 

#### The Diagnosis

My patient clearly is suffering from a distinct case of *Lack of Moral Grounding*. This is the most logical explanation for his lack of bodily unity and degeneracy. Having a *Lack of Moral Grounding*  would also lead to other symtoms in seamingly separate from the moral system of the body. For instance, one might expect the circulation of the econosystem to suffer due to *Greedy Organ Syndrome*. 

#### The Prognosis

I prescribe two things. The first is to alleviate the symptoms, the second to address the cause. 

1) A liberal application of charity. It is clear that I do not mean the newer kind of charity that has come out in the recent 200 years. That sort of thinking has what has lead to such a lack of useful diagnoses for my patient. This newer charity has removed the active ingredients and left just the stuff, leading to a innert applicant that does not help anyone. If the patient were to administer this sort of charity, it would be no more useful than giving moisturizing cream to a man who is dying of thirst. The patient requires the older kind of charity. Any pharmisist worth his salt will know what I mean. With an *extrememly* liberal application of this stuff, the patient's symptoms of divisiveness should decrease although the actual causes will not go away. Additionally, this should help to temper the circulatory issues, although it will not heal the cause and so will continue to plague the patient until the second treatment is administered.

2) An entire upending of his moral framework. Unfortunately my patient has been living his life as if he had no need for a moral base. This is of course silly and must be addressed. There is no drug I can prescribe for this. This illness requires theraputic exercise. His moral base has not been exercised in centruies and indeed I doubt if it was ever properly developed in the first place. This will undoubtably be an uncomfortable treatment and it is perhaps for this cause that my patient has not heeded the advice of his doctors in the past. I hope for his own good, he will this time, although it seems unlikely considering his stubborn and willful disposition.
